# Hangman In Python
Fall 2021 

For my final project in CS111(Carleton College) I created a Python OOP Hangman game using the John Zelle's graphics library. 
The first file is hangman.py which contains the main algorithim behind our code.
The second file runs the game, hence why it's called RunGame.py.
The final file is scrabble_dictionary.txt, from which we chose a random word for our hangman game The graphics.py documentation
in order to run the graphics portion of the game. 

Rules and Regulations of the Game:
You play the game by guessing words and letters to find out the unknown random word.
This is done by typing W and L, depending on whether you want to guess a word or letter.
You can not guess the same word or letter twice and the incorrect guesses will appear in a
life/chance belong lost. The incorrect guesses will appear in the green space below the gallows.
You have 8 chances before your hangman dies, so think through each choice!
